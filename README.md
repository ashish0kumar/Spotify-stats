3. Configure Spotify API credentials:
Create a Spotify App on the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
Obtain your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET.`
Set the `REDIRECT_URI` to http://localhost:5173/callback/ (you can set it to any URL you want to but you'll have to edit `REDIRECT_URI` in the script as well to match it) in your Spotify App settings.
